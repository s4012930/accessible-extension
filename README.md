## Description

The Accessibility Booster Chrome Extension enhances your browsing experience by adding a suite of accessibility features to any website. It aims to make the web more usable for everyone, including individuals with disabilities. The extension is lightweight and incredibly easy to use

---

## Features

This extension provides a variety of features to improve web accessibility, including:

* **High Contrast Mode:** Increases text visibility and reduces eye strain.
* **Dyslexia-Friendly Font:** Applies a font designed to be easier to read for users with dyslexia (e.g., OpenDyslexic).
* **Reading Line:** Adds a line to help focus while reading.
* **Colourblind Adjustments:** Offers filters for various types of colour blindness (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia).
* **Reduced Motion:** Minimizes animations and motion effects.
* **Keyboard Navigation Enhancements:** Improves focus indicators and tab navigation.
* **Large Click Targets:** Increases the size of interactive elements.
* **Custom Cursor:** Provides alternative cursor styles for better visibility along with greater size.
* **Auto Scroll:** Enables automatic page scrolling with zones at the top and bottom.
* **Hover Controls:** Provides controls that appear on hover for easier interaction.
* **Focus Mode:** Dims the surrounding page content to highlight the active reading area similar to the reading line.
* **Highlight Links:** Makes all links on a page highlighted.
* **Reading Progress Bar:** Shows a visual indicator at the top for how far you've scrolled through a page.
* **Image Descriptions (Alt Text Viewer):** Helps users see alternative text for images when hovering over them.

## Tech Stack

* TypeScript
* React (for the popup UI)
* Vite (for building and development server)
* Vitest (for testing)
* ESLint (for code linting)
* CSS (for styling accessibility features)
* Chrome Extensions API

---

## Solution Design

The extension is designed to be modular and scalable, with each accessibility feature implemented as a separate module. The popup UI is built with React for a modern, responsive experience. State is managed globally and persisted using Chrome's storage API, ensuring settings are applied across all tabs and sessions.

- **State Management:** All feature toggles and settings are stored in a global state object and persisted using Chrome's `storage.sync` API.
- **Performance:** Debounced storage writes and efficient tab messaging ensure minimal performance impact.
- **Accessibility First:** All UI components are designed with accessibility in mind, including ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

* `npm run dev`: Starts the development server using Vite.
* `npm run build`: Builds the extension for production (compiles TypeScript, Vite build, and copies CSS).
* `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
* `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.
* `npm run test`: Runs tests once using Vitest.
* `npm run test:watch`: Runs tests in watch mode.
* `npm run test:ui`: Opens the Vitest UI for an interactive testing experience.
* `npm run test:html`: Runs tests and generates an HTML report (`test-results.html`), then attempts to open it.

---

## Testing

To run the automated tests for this extension:

* For a single run:
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
* To run tests and view results in an HTML report:
    ```bash
    npm run test:html
    ```
    This will generate `test-results.html` in the root directory.
* For an interactive UI:
    ```bash
    npm run test:ui
    ```

* My Recommendation:
    ```bash
    npm run test:ui
    ```

```bash
npm run lint
```
If all checks pass, you'll see:
